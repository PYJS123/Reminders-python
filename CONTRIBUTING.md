# CONTRIBUTING
To contribute to this piece of work, please make a new branch and ***do not*** immediately contribute to the main branch. Then, simply make a pull request. This will be reviewed and tested and (hopefully) merged into main.
If you can't be bothered to make a new branch, ***please do not*** go around main editing things unless you have been given expressed permission.
Otherwise, just fork or clone or make a copy or something like that, and I'll hopefully find it and congratulate you.
