# Reminders-python
A way to keep your reminders stored crudely in a text file in a way that could cause some serious errors.

## STEPS TO DOWNLOAD:
1. Download repository
2. Extract to any location
3. Make sure all directories leading to the files are not 'read-only' by following these instructions on each file and directory to them (for Windows and every other OS for all I know):
   1. Right-click the file/directory
   2. Click 'Properties'
   3. Un-check the 'Read-only' box
   4. Do all the bla-dee-bla it tells you to do
   5. Click 'Apply' and 'OK'
4. Open the python file and have a nice day using the world's most to-the-metal version of a reminder-keeper (?).
